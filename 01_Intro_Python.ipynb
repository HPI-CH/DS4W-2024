Click on it to download the latest version of Python. The website should automatically suggest the best version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n","\n","3. **Run the installer:**\n","   Once the download is complete, run the installer. During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH.\" This will make it easier to run Python from the command line.\n","\n","4. **Complete the installation:**\n","   Follow the prompts to complete the installation. After the installation is finished, you can verify that Python is installed correctly by opening a command prompt (or terminal) and typing `python --version`.

To use the `draw_game` function from the `draw` module, we need to specify which module the function is in by using the dot operator.
